# Project: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with Pandas

## Phase 1

* Remove remove extra spaces from column descriptions and drop unneccesary/duplicate columns.
* Prioritize which data is most important (Date of attack), so remove any rows with this information missing

## Phase 2
* Fix time and date formatting:
* Since Date of attack is most important, Date and Time formatted for easier analysis

##Phase 3
* Clean up other columns for more consistent analysis where things can easily be standardized (ie: gender, fatality)

##Phase 4
* Update datatypes where possible

## Phase 5
* Export clean data to csv
